## Overview

This document outlines the major bugs that were discovered and resolved in the
Scheduling App
---

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Multiple time calling of send-confirmation

**File**: `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem

The send-confirmation suspense edge function service was being triggered twice during the lead capture process.

#### Root Cause

The function was invoked once for saving form data into the database and a second time for sending the confirmation email, leading to redundant API calls.

#### Fix

Refactored the code to ensure that the send-confirmation module is called only once after form submission, thereby combining the database save and email send logic into a single API call.

#### Impact

- âœ… The API will now be called only once after form submission, reducing redundant requests and improving performance.

---

### 1. Supabase CLI local setup

**File**: `package.json, supabase/config.toml,`
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem

The backend could not be started locally due to missing dependencies and outdated configuration settings.

#### Root Cause

The Supabase CLI was missing from the devDependencies in package.json, and the config.toml file contained configurations compatible only with a previous Supabase version.

#### Fix

Added Supabase CLI to devDependencies in package.json.
Updated supabase/config.toml to align with the latest Supabase configuration format.

```json
"devDependencies": {
    "supabase": "^2.33.9",
}
```

```toml
[auth.sms.test_otp]
"1234567890" = "123456"

#Removed code

[auth]
email_double_confirm_changes = true


[auth.sms]
test_otp = "123456"

[edge_runtime]
enabled = true
ip_version = "ipv4"

[[edge_runtime.policies]]
entrypoint = "main"
source = """
import "jsr:@supabase/functions-js/edge-runtime.d.ts"

console.log("Hello from Functions!")
"""

```

#### Impact

- âœ… Developers can now successfully set up and run the Supabase backend locally without errors.

---

### 3. Absense of OPENAI_API_KEY backup

**File**: `supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts`
**Severity**: High
**Status**: âœ… Critical

#### Problem

The function generatePersonalizedContent did not provide a fallback message if the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable was missing.

#### Root Cause

No conditional logic was implemented to handle the scenario where the API key is unavailable, resulting in potential runtime failures without a meaningful response.

#### Fix

Added a backup text message that is returned when the OPENAI_API_KEY is missing.
Implemented an error-handling condition to log a warning and return a default welcome message.
Added explicit error logging for any OpenAI API errors.

```ts
// Backend
if (!apiKey) {
    console.warn("OPEN API KEY is missing");
    return `Hi ${name}! ðŸš€ Welcome to our innovation community! We're thrilled to have someone from the ${industry} industry join us. Get ready to discover cutting-edge insights, connect with fellow innovators, and unlock new opportunities that will transform how you work. This is just the beginning of your innovation journey!`;
  }

if (data.error) {
    console.error("OpenAI API Error: ", data.error);
    throw new Error(data.error.message || "OpenAI request failed");
}
```

#### Impact

- âœ… Ensures the application provides a meaningful default message even if the OPENAI_API_KEY is absent.
- âœ… Improves reliability and user experience by preventing failures during content generation.
